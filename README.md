# 👋 Hi, I’m Anas

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I am a Junior Software Engineer with hands-on experience building end-to-end web applications and a growing focus on Generative AI systems. I’ve worked across backend and frontend development and learned how modern applications are designed, built, and integrated.

Over the past year I’ve gained practical exposure to GenAI concepts such as LLM-powered features and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I’ve applied these ideas in real projects like document-based Q&A systems and AI-assisted chat applications. I enjoy combining AI capabilities with clean backend logic and simple user interfaces to build practical solutions.

I’m passionate about continuous learning, writing maintainable code, and building solutions that solve real problems. Currently, I’m focused on strengthening my fundamentals while growing into an engineer who can contribute effectively to intelligent, production-ready systems.
